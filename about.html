        <p>
          I have been interested in computers and technology since high school.
          In college I took my first programming class and wasn't all that
          intrigued at the time, maybe something to do with the course itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In early 2018, I was looking into a career change and decided to check
          out programming and web development again. I signed up for a free
          online code school(freecodecamp.org) and since then I have been
          hooked.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few months of that I wanted a little more structured eductaion
          so I gave TeamTreehouse a trial and really enjoyed it. I have since
          completed their FullStack JavaScript track and many other related
          courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          While learning I have built dozens of projects for fun each one
          becoming more complex as I learn more frameworks and libraries. Most
          of these can be see on my
          <a href="https://github.com/TheHuns">GitHub</a> account or here on
          <a href="/myWork.html">My Work</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still love learing new technologies as much as I did when I started
          this and can't wait to see what comes next!
