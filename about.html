            <p>
              I grew up in a suburban area just outside of Houston, Tx. I was
              very fortunate to have great family and friends all living near
              by. We spent time often at the beach and lakes trying to beat the
              heat. I eventually went to Texas Tech and the University of
              Houston where i did study some Computer Science.

            <p>
              More or less on a whim one winter, after having my fill of Houston
              traffic, I deceided to move to Durango, CO. During my decade here
              I have thouroughly enjoyed myself working and playing outdoors as
              much as possible. After getting married and haveing our daughter
              it was time to rethinnk my career path, which led me back around
              to my interests in technology. Happy now to be working toward a
              line of work which for me is filled with pride and challenge!
